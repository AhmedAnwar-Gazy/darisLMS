A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Level 1 breaks down the single "System" node from the Level 0 Context Diagram into its major functional sub-processes. It shows how data moves between these internal processes and the data stores (database tables).
Here is the list of the major processes (bubbles) included in the DarisLMS Level 1 DFD, followed by the detailed breakdown for each.
List of Processes (Level 1 Nodes)
1.	Process 1.0: Manage Users & Authentication
2.	Process 2.0: Manage Courses & Content
3.	Process 3.0: Manage Enrollments
4.	Process 4.0: Assessments & Grading
5.	Process 5.0: Communication & Notifications
6.	Process 6.0: Search & Discovery

Visual Guide for Drawing DFD Level 1
If you are drawing this diagram, follow this layout:
1.	Center: Arrange the 6 circular Processes (1.0 to 6.0) in the middle.
2.	Left Side: Place External Entities Student and Guest.
3.	Right Side: Place External Entities Instructor and Admin.
4.	Bottom: Place External Entities Cloud Storage, Email Service, and TypeSense.
5.	Center/Between Processes: Place the Open-Ended Rectangles for Data Stores (D1 to D7).
6.	Connect: Draw arrows based on the inputs and outputs listed above. For example, draw an arrow from Student to Process 4.0 labeled "Submission," then an arrow from Process 4.0 to D6: Grades Table labeled "Save Grade."
